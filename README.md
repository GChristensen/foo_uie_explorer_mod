foo_uie_explorer_mod
---

A modified filesystem explorer panel component for the foobar2000.

The original component could be found 
[here](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=34207)

The modified version allows to customize default folder icon in the filesystem
tree by replacing it at the foobar's copy of the system icon image list.

This has a couple of disadvantages:

* The small folder icon will also be replaced in foobar Open/Save dialogs
* Customized or special folder icons will be left intact
